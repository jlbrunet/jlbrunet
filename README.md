<h2> Hi there 👋 I'm Julie Brunet! </h2>

<p>👩‍💻 I am a fullstack web developer based in Paris. Passionate about the art of creating functional and aesthetic websites, I went through the Wagon training to learn the fundamentals of code and object-oriented programming.</p>

<p>🌱 Self-learner, I then continued to educate myself by exploring new technologies and taking on exciting challenges. I had the opportunity to work on various websites, both in teams and solo. These experiences allowed me to gain diverse expertise, ranging from design to programming, and subsequently ensuring the maintenance of websites.</p>

<p>🚀 Today, I bring this passion and expertise to my projects and clients, creating innovative web solutions tailored to their needs.</p>
